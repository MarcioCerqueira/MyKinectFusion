	This is my version of the KinectFusion that supports Augmented Reality with polygonal surfaces or medical volumes.
	The polygonal surfaces can be any .obj
	The medical volumes can be found at the other branch of my repository.
	To compile it, one will need:
		OpenGL
		PCL (and 3rdParty)
		CUDA
		OpenCV
